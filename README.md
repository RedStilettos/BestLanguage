# BestLanguage
My very own programming language. 

I am going to write a programming language. 
Let's be real, I have no idea what I'm doing but I do have a ton of free time
so that kind of combo tends to work out right? :D

Source Language: What's in a name?
Target Language: I should pick LLVM, but because I like pain let's go with x86-64.
Implementation Language: OCaml, or SML. Or haskell but probably not.
